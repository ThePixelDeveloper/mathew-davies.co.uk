I'll be basing my build off the powerful "[Beastbox](http://instructables.com/id/How-to-make-a-trailer-mounted-bike-sound-system/?ALLSTEPS)", so it only makes sense this project is named:

==============

I'll be attempting to out-perform it by a few dB and make more use of the battery packs. We'll see if I succeed or not. 
Part 2  is coming soon which will go through about streaming sound to a remote system.
