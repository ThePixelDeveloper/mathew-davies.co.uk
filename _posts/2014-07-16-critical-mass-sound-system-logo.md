I didn't expect this, so it came as a shock when a good friend of mine [Dave Stewart](http://davestewart.co.uk/) decided 
to create a logo for me. Here it is:

He kindly created an animated version as well, imagine the sound waves acting as a graphic equalizer!

I don't have the time to work on this, but would love to see it. I wont be at all mad if someone beats me to the line.
